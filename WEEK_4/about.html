                    <p>This is an about copypasta paragraph. Spongebob could easily defeat Thanos with the full infinity gauntlet and here’s why: In a video game Jimmy Neutron makes something for Spongebob that makes him big enough to actually fight Thanos. In Sponge Out of Water Spongebob has a magic paper where he can rewrite the plot so he defeats Thanos. Spongebob has also been seen in episodes multiple times manipulating the plot. In another video game Spongebob also has a magic paper in his head where he can rewrite the plot so that the infinity gauntlet has no effect on him and he can steal it or one shot Thanos. In the cartoon although there are inconsistencies, Spongebob is very good at karate and has been training for many years. If Thanos also manages to land a hit on the legend known as Spongebob, as shown from when he was hit by Flats he would laugh off the punch and it would have no effect. I rest my case</p>
