            <h2>WHAT IS VAPORWAVE?</h2>
            <p>Vaporwave is a microgenre of electronic music and an Internet meme that emerged in the early 2010s The style is defined by its appropriation of 1980s and 1990s mood music styles such as smooth jazz, elevator music, R&B, and lounge music, typically sampling or manipulating tracks via chopped and screwed techniques and other effects. Its surrounding subculture is sometimes associated with an ambiguous or satirical take on consumer capitalism and pop culture, and tends to be characterized by a nostalgic or surrealist engagement with the popular entertainment, technology and advertising of previous decades. It also incorporates early Internet imagery, late 1990s web design, glitch art, anime, 3D-rendered objects, and cyberpunk tropes in its cover artwork and music videos.

                Originating as an ironic variant of chillwave, vaporwave was loosely derived from the experimental tendencies of the mid-2000s hypnagogic pop scene. The style was pioneered by producers such as James Ferraro, Daniel Lopatin, and Ramona Xavier, who each used various pseudonyms.[19] A circle of online producers were particularly inspired by Xavier's Floral Shoppe (2011), which established a blueprint for the genre. The movement subsequently built an audience on sites Last.fm, Reddit and 4chan while a flood of new acts, also operating under online pseudonyms, turned to Bandcamp for distribution. Following the wider exposure of vaporwave in 2012, a wealth of subgenres and offshoots emerged, such as future funk, mallsoft, and hardvapour.</p>

            <h2>CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
            <p>Vaporwave is an Internet-based microgenre that was built upon the experimental and ironic tendencies of genres such as chillwave and hypnagogic pop. It draws primarily on musical and cultural sources from the 1980s and early 1990s while also being associated with an ambiguous or satirical take on consumer capitalism and technoculture.[3] Early incarnations of vaporwave relied on the sampling of sources such as Japanese city pop, smooth jazz, retro elevator music, R&B, lounge music, and dance music from the 1980s and 1990s.[6] The music consists of "brief, cut-up sketches", cleanly produced, and composed almost entirely from samples,[3] along with the application of slowed-down chopped and screwed techniques, looping, and other effects.[5][3][12] Critic Adam Trainer writes of the style's predilection for "music made less for enjoyment than for the regulation of mood," such as corporate stock music for infomercials and product demonstrations.[20] Musicologist Adam Harper described the typical vaporwave track as "a wholly synthesised or heavily processed chunk of corporate mood music, bright and earnest or slow and sultry, often beautiful, either looped out of sync and beyond the point of functionality."[3]

                The style's visual aesthetic (often stylized as "ＡＥＳＴＨＥＴＩＣＳ", with fullwidth characters)[21] incorporates early Internet imagery, late 1990s web design, glitch art, and cyberpunk tropes,[11] as well as anime, Greco-Roman statues, and 3D-rendered objects.[22] VHS degradation is another common effect seen in vaporwave art. Generally, artists limit their source material between Japan's economic flourishing in the 1980s and the September 11 attacks or dot-com bubble burst of 2001 (some albums, including Floral Shoppe, depict the intact Twin Towers on their covers).[23]</p>

            <h2>HISTORY</h2>
            <p>2009–2011: Origins and early scene
                See also: Chillwave, Hypnagogic pop, and Seapunk
                Vaporwave originated on the Internet as an ironic variant of chillwave,[24] drawing on the retro style's "analog nostalgia"[6] as well as the work of hypnagogic pop artists such as Ariel Pink and James Ferraro, who were also characterized by the invocation of retro popular culture.[25] "Hypnagogic pop" was coined by Wire journalist David Keenan in August 2009, only a few weeks after "chillwave", to describe a host of new underground acts who were inspired by the memories of their childhoods in the 1980s. The two terms were often used interchangeably with each other.[26] According to Vice, vaporwave was one of several short-lived internet genres to emerge during the era: "there was chillwave, witch house, seapunk, shitgaze, vaporwave, cloud rap, and countless other niche sounds with gimmicky names. As soon as one microgenre flamed out, another would take its place, and with it a whole new set of beats, buzz artists, and fashion trends."[27] Ash Becks of The Essential notes that sites like Pitchfork and Drowned in Sound "seemingly refused to touch vaporwave throughout the genre’s two-year 'peak'."[14]</p>

            <div class="twoAh"><h2>Machintosh Plus A.K.A. Vektroid </h2></div>
            <p>FTaking inspiration from her predecessors, Vektroid, born Ramona Andra Xavier, in Washington State, fused the themes from Lopatin’s Ecco Jam 1 and Ferraro’s Far side Virtual into the masterpiece largely responsible for popularizing Vaporwave music - Floral Shoppe.

                    Floral Shoppe was released under one of Vektroid’s many aliases, Macintosh Plus and to date is the only studio album released under this alias. Following the release of Floral Shoppe, Vektroid aka Macintosh Plus, quickly gathered a following for people interested in her strange, droning take on '80s funk and elevator music.
                    
                    Floral Shoppe opened the floodgates for a number of artists looking to share in this unique, anti-consumerist, nearly anonymous and ironic take on '80s and '90s subculture. The Vaporwave music sub-genre essentially embodied these sentiments by essentially promoting the appropriation and remixing of older music into newer explorations of hyperreality.</p>

            <p>In September of 2012, Patrick Driscoll, known by the alias Blank Banshee, would rise to become the savior of Vaporwave with the release of his self-titled and self-released album, Blank Banshee Zero. Blank Banshee Zero would reform the Vaporwave genre by introducing a classic Vaporwave sound fused with a trap beats and heavy bass drops.</p>

            <div class="twoCh"><h2>James Ferraro</h2></div>
            <p>Enter James Ferraro a musician, vocalist, producer and composer, known for his exploration of hyperreality and consumer culture. Around the same time that ‘Chuck Person’ released Ecco Jams 1, James released a project called Far Side Virtual, which true to his style explored consumerism through the lenses of globalization and internet culture.

                    Unknown to both James and Daniel Lopatin, these two styles would become the basis for what would soon be considered the album that defined Vaporwave as a genre, Floral Shoppe.</p>
