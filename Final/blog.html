                                    Come celebrate Planet Earth with the STARs! On Sunday, April 17th, 2016, the eco-friendly folks here at the STAR Eco Station
                                    and STAR Education are throwing our 16th Annual Children’s Earth Day Extravaganza in the only way we know how...HUGE! GREEN!
                                    AND FOR ALL AGES! This mega celebration will feature exotic wildlife, student performances, eco-friendly games and rides, 
                                    face painting, tons of food, celebrity guests from Disney, ABC, Nickelodeon and more! Did we mention that admission is FREE?!
                                    <br><br>
                                    Last year, more than 30,000 people attended this one-of-a-kind celebration, which has been recognized as the LA Times’ “Best Earth Day Pick” 
                                    and “Best Children’s Earth Day” by LA Parent Magazine. This year will be bigger and better, with an exclusive trailer screening
                                    of Disney’s new film The Jungle Book, along with a super cool Green Screen Photo Booth for interactive Disney fun. We are also 
                                    bringing back the rescued wolves from the shows such as HBO’s Game of Thrones and True Blood.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Children's Earth Day is also a perfect time to tour the STAR Eco Station exotic wildlife rescue center at a discounted rate. 
                                    In addition to over 300 animals, we have just welcomed a young Bobcat, a Red Fox and two Silver-phase Red Foxes to our sanctuary. 
                                    So be sure to join us as we promote “PRESERVATION THROUGH EDUCATION” and enlighten our Los Angeles community with a multisensory 
                                    experience that everyone can enjoy!

                                    necessity of environmentally mindful living that ECO aims to impact not only our Earth of today, but our Earth for generations 
                                    to come. Preservation of our natural resources is the greatest gift we can give to our children and to our childrens children.

                                    STAR ECO believes that the impact will be great and the benefits to humanity immeasurable.

                            can be diminished if we are all in this mission together. It is through educating California communities on the benefits and 
                            necessity of environmentally mindful living that ECO aims to impact not only our Earth of today, but our Earth for generations 
                            to come. Preservation of our natural resources is the greatest gift we can give to our children and to our childrens children. 
                            If we align as one community under this mission to preserve wildlife habitats and educate our peers about environmental responsibility, 
                            STAR ECO believes that the impact will be great and the benefits to humanity immeasurable.
